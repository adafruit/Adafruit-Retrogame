Documentaion on How to install Retrogame into Retropie with GPIO buttons.

Boot up Retrogame, preferrably with SSH enabled, so you access your pi remotely. This can be done with ethernet or wifi, depending on your situation.

First if your 'Adafruit-Retrogame' file has the 'gamera.c' file you need to type:
sudo apt-get install ncurses-dev libexpat1-dev - obviously you will need an internet connection.

if you don't have 'gamera.c' just skip that step.

first unzip files on a PC/Mac/Linux machine (trust me it's easier), pull the whole 'Adafruit-Retrogame' over to you Pi. in the /pi/home/ folder.

Then edit the retrogame.c file to correspond to your button/gpio layout.

Ctl-X, Y, enter. This exits and saves it. You can also edit the file on your computer. Then move the new file over to replace the old one.

then, type: sudo make.

wait for the build to finish.

next type: sudo modprobe uinput. this gets the uinput kernel.

to make this persistent (run at boot), (with quotations) type: sudo sh -c 'echo uinput >> /etc/modules'

to test, type: sudo ./retrogame

make sure all of your buttons work, plus each direction on joystick.

Then ctl-c to quit the test.

type: sudo nano /etc/rc.local

Before the final “exit 0” line, insert this line: /home/pi/Adafruit-Retrogame/retrogame &

Next type: sudo nano /etc/udev/rules.d/10-retrogame.rules

Add this line: SUBSYSTEM=="input", ATTRS{name}=="retrogame", ENV{ID_INPUT_KEYBOARD}="1"

if the line is already there don't worry about it.

type: sudo reboot
